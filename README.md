## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

This document contains the following details:
- Description of the Topologu
- Access Policies

  - Beats in Use

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting IP's to the network.
- This load balancer is set up to also help against DOS attacks by ensuring the distributed load on both servers.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the VM's and system files.
- Filebeat collects log files from the file system generated by the Microsoft Azure tools.
- Metric beat records machine metrics such as uptime and downtime.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function     | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway      | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| Web1     |DVWA Host     | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web2     |DVWA Host     | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK box  |Server Monitor| 10.0.1.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the jump-box provisioner machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 97.117.121.133
- 

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the jump box provisioner with an internal IP of 10.0.0.4

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | 10.0.0.1  10.0.0.2  97.117.121.133 |
| Web1 & 2 | No                  |        10.0.0.4   10.0.1.4         |
|  ELK VM  | No                  |              10.0.0.4              |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because the time to automate the tasks needed for setup was faster than manually creating those same tasks.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Docker installation and setup
- Python3 installation 
- Docker Module Installation
- Virtual Memory increased
- Virtual Memory on restart increased
- download and launch docker ELK container

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web1: 10.0.0.5
- Web2: 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat monitors logs and data at specific locations on a systems server. The monitored data is delivered to the configured output at least once, which in this case is Kibana.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the configuration file to Ansible directory.
- Update the configuration file to include the servers that are being monitored through their IP's.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to the ELK Docker container by typing [sudo docker ps -a] to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? The playbook that How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? The "hosts" file is where machines are given a host name to have playbook files installed on. Here, the two web machines are on a "webservers" host and the ELK machine is on a "ELK" host.
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://[ELK-VM-IP]:5601/app/kibana
