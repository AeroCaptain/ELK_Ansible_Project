#ELK_Ansible_Project
About: 
	This project was done during my Cybersecurity Bootcamp Through the University of Utah. This project was created to showcase my abilities and mastery learned through the course.
	The Project itself is the creation of an ELK Server to monitor a DVWA web client and record logs and data on a remote server. The project includes the installation of a jump box provisioner to connect to a Docker container that configures the two web machines and the ELK machine. A load balancer was included to maintain the availability of the two web machines.
